<H2>The Story</H2>
<C>
This blog post was inspired by a recent conversation with a friend who had completed yet another ripoff JavaScript bootcamp. When they asked me whether they should start with 
<L href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring</L>, <L href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</L>, or <L href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</L>, I got confused. The question seemed misguided, I first thought about redirecting their focus towards a foundational understanding of <L href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">HTTP</L> and grasp the protocol's essence first, as they all do the same thing really. But then I soon realized the broader issue at hand: the misconception that learning involves a linear progression of hopping from one tool to another, across different languages and ecosystems.
<S/>
It became apparent that my friend's inquiry about different frameworks operating on totally different languages and ecosystems, neither of which they were even proficient in, reflected a common misunderstanding. 
My advice was: focus on learning more fundamentals. Better yet, grasp how computers operate. So I ended up sending them a copy of "The C Programming Language" book and advised them to start there. Reflecting on this, I realized my advice was somewhat selfish, as I didn't want to lecture for 30 minutes about the importance of fundamentals and where to even begin.
